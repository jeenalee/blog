    <p>Short answer is: I don’t know the best answer.</p>

<p>And here goes the long answer.</p>

<h3 id="challenges-as-a-learner">Challenges as a Learner</h3>
<p>I first learned how to program about 3 years ago. I was a biology researcher at a biotech startup, making yeast strains that create spider silk. I was also living in San Francisco at the time, where programming was <em>everywhere</em>. So I decided to give it a try completely out of city-wide peer pressure. Someone told me I should learn Java first, and after 2 weeks or so, I stopped.</p>

<p>Why did I stop learning? What discouraged me from going further?</p>

<p>First of all, I started off with printing “Hello World” in Java and later went to a meetup, but nothing made sense during the meetup. I thought “this is too confusing! I quit.” This totally makes sense because I went to a JavaScript meetup thinking JavaScript is the same as Java. Oops! Could be the person who recommended Java was actually talking about JavaScript? I’ll never know.</p>

<p>Secondly, making computers print things (which is usually the first step in many tutorials) was not inherently exciting to me. I knew nothing about computers at that time, and I remember thinking <em>what’s so fun about making letters appear on the screen?</em> This seems to be a common first roadblock to many people. Ashley <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNe1i7nVbXI">talked</a> about how programming a calculator was not an exciting way to learn computers for her, because she already owned several. I didn’t find printing “Hello” on my computer fun, because I could already make a slideshow where the words spin and change colors! I can already do that without knowing how to program, so why should I bother learning how to make computer print boring letters?</p>

<p>This brings my train of thoughts to going to <a href="http://psas.pdx.edu/">Portland State Aerospace Society</a> meeting for the first time recently. A super friendly mechanical engineer showed us the rocket room, where the magic happens. He talked about the different kinds of fuels (things that explode!), a rocket engine nozzle made by 3D printing some metal (I didn’t even know that was possible!), and the sad accidents when the parachute doesn’t deploy correctly (crashing rockets!). It was no doubt one of the coolest things I’ve seen lately.</p>

<p>Then a software engineer showed us the fruit of his labor – a computer that prints the degree of shakenness when it’s shaken. There were 4 numbers that kept changing when you shook the thing. This information is very important for the rocket to correct its trajectory when it’s flying in the sky. That is really, <strong>really</strong> cool. Think about all the sensors that interact with each other, and how the computer parses that information to a human readable format! What about delivering that data to other rocket parts so that it can correct its shakenness? That’s so awesome.</p>

<p>But the thing is, me 3 years ago wouldn’t have found this computer interesting. It just prints numbers after all. Me at present day find it so fascinating that I want to get my hands messy with it. And it’s probably because I could imagine the challenges behind this, and I have some understanding of how computer works. If you want to find something fun, you have to know some basics of it. And the road to knowing the said basics can be quite mundane.</p>

<h3 id="challenges-as-a-teacher">Challenges as a Teacher</h3>

<p>So the real challenge to teaching is keeping people motivated and interested during that “boring” first part, so they can have a blast later. I recently had to think about this hard when I was a Teaching Assistant for the first biology course for undergraduates.</p>

<p>When I tell people I studied biology, people sometimes say “wow, you must be so good at memorizing.” This is an unfortunate misunderstanding. To picture why, this would be equivalent to saying “wow, you must be so good at memorizing syntax” to programmers. Yes, remembering syntax is important, but that’s the first step to making and understanding a system that’s much larger and more fun. My goal as a Biology TA was to make this first step of “memorizing” as painless as possible. After that, hopefully they could see what I was seeing, which is a much larger system called biology. Every living organism is a carefully calibrated intricate system that has a specification scripted in DNA. When you’re thinking, seeing, or even sleeping, electricity is flowing through your neurons. Your body physically breaks the tiniest chemical bonds in your food so that it can be converted into energy.</p>

<p>So what attempts did I make?</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I tried so hard<sup><a href="#ref_0">0</a></sup> to keep the scope of learning small. Beginners don’t have to know <em>everything</em>, but just the necessities to understand the current scope. Then we expand the scope by a bit. Should I talk about the hydrogen bonds that drive adenine to bind with thymine, and cytosine to bind with guanine, when this is the first time they’re hearing the word DNA? Probably not. Will it be really cool to dive deep later? YES. Similarly, is it necessary to learn that there are multiple implementations of garbage collector, when I don’t know anything about garbage collector? No. Will it be cool to learn them later when I have some knowledge of garbage collector? Absolutely yes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I tried to connect the new concepts to something they are already familiar with. I could go on and on about the central dogma, the different components behind activating a gene, and the mechanism of translation. But is that the best way to get introduced to DNA? I don’t think so. Instead, I compared DNA to English alphabets. We use 26 symbols to create documents that are vastly different. In biology, every living organism uses 4 symbols, and with different combintaions of them, we get proteins with different meanings like breaking down food, or making your armpits smelly<sup><a href="#ref_1">1</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="motivation-to-learn">Motivation to Learn</h3>

<p>I wrote earlier that I first learned how to program 3 years ago and stopped after 2 weeks. What brought me back to pick up where I left a little more than a year ago? This is the interesting and important part.</p>

<p>One day, I wanted to make a spreadsheet where one column was a gene symbol, and the next column was its corresponding protein function. I thought of going through a couple databases and manually copy and pasting them. Then my coworker showed me that I could write a program to do it automatically. I said “YOU CAN DO THAT???” And then I thought <em>I want to learn how to do this</em>.</p>

<p>I find myself saying the same thing whenever I get excited to learn something new. You can write an interpreter from scratch?? <em>How? Show me!</em>. You can learn how to make a mug from clay? <em>I want to learn</em>. You can contribute to a web browser engine?? <em>Teach me how!</em> You can make a rocket as an amateur? <em>I want to learn!!</em> If I had the same reaction to printing “Hello World” on my computer screen, I would’ve been a lot more motivated to continue learning.</p>

<p>Learning how to program is no different from learning anything else. I have to get excited about its application, which is when I go “What? You can do that?” Then, I have to stay motivated during the initial “boring” part. If the teacher makes it as easy as it gets, that’s perfect. Then, hopefully I’ll be able to see what my teacher sees. Once I get to a not-so-beginner level, it becomes easier to repeat this process on my own.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-we-teach-rust-to-complete-beginners">How do we teach Rust to complete beginners?</h3>

<p>This brings us to what prompted my train of thoughts. There have been a lot of efforts in the Rust community to explore ways to teach Rust to complete beginners. I learned about the existence of command line about a year ago, and Rust was my first compiled language. I had never learned C or C++ before and had only used Python here and there. I had asked my partner why I should use many functions instead of having just one big function a year ago. So, while I wasn’t a complete beginner, I was a semi beginner when I learned Rust three months ago.</p>

<p>Many people like Rust because of its advantages over C or C++, but that motivation didn’t apply to me, because I don’t know those languages. I had never done systems level programming or really knew of the computer architecture, so the words heap and stack were foreign to me. Similarly, zero-cost abstraction didn’t make sense to me until much more recently. Rust helped me understand those concepts so much, and I grew as a programmer a lot over the past three months. So I think it’s a great gateway language to understanding computer science concepts. I cannot be more grateful to my mentors and teachers who kept me motivated while I learned Rust, and I think everyone who wants to have a tangible entry to abstract concepts should learn Rust.</p>

<p>But I think it doesn’t make sense to spill the jargons (garbage collection, memory, static types, and so on) to complete beginners. Instead, maybe we should think what motivates people to learn something new. What makes a toddler reach out their arms further? Would it be a white screen that prints “Hello World” in monospace? Or would it be a colorful toy that makes sound and moves on its own?</p>

<p>Teaching Rust to people who’ve never heard of command line will be definitely different from the way we teach Rust to people who are experienced programmers. It might come with a cost of not showing all the cool things about Rust in the beginning, because if we do, it might just cause more confusion. So for complete beginners, maybe we should show people what we can do with Rust that is inherently interesting. And with Rust being a systems level language, maybe this means programming a moving robot, or making your own sunrise alarm clock. After that, we can focus on learning about the related deeper concepts because there’s no timeline in learning! However, getting people excited, and keeping them motivated during that first hump of “boring” phase should have a higher priority.</p>

<p>I don’t have concrete ideas on how to do that. But maybe all it takes is some empathy. It’s really easy to forget what it was like to learn something from ground zero. And I think great teachers try hard to remember what it was like.</p>

<p id="ref_0"><small><sup>0</sup>...and I got so far. In the end, it definitely mattered.
