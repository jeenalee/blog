<p>
  Here, I implemented two different set algorithms in Python, sorted list
  and unsorted list. I also compared their
  performances for inserting and searching a value in a set. The
  link to my code on GitHub
  is <a href="https://github.com/jeenalee/set_algorithms">here</a>. This
  is the first part of 2-part series. In the next blog entry, I
  will write about balanced and unbalanced trees, and their performances.
</p>

<h2>Algorithms</h2>
<p>
  The two algorithms I compared are sorted list and unsorted
  list. These are the steps I took for my project:
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;With a set algorithm, for each n = 2<sup>5</sup>, 2<sup>9</sup>, 2<sup>13</sup>, and 2<sup>17</sup>:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  1. Create a set S1, and time the following:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  a. Insert each even number in range(0, n) in order into a set S1.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  b. Check whether S1 contains each value in range(0, n).<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  2. Create a list of n random numbers, and a new set S2. Time the following:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  a. Insert the first n/2 random numbers into S2.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  b. Check whether S2 contains each random number.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In summary, I tested insertion and containment check for n sizes of 2<sup>4</sup>,
  2<sup>8</sup>, 2<sup>12</sup>, and 2<sup>16</sup>, in incremental and random orders.
</p>

<h3>Sorted List Set</h3>
<p>
  When a <code>SortedListSet</code> is initialized, it creates an empty list:
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    class SortedListSet(object):
    def __init__(self):
    self.values = []
  </code>
</pre>
<p>
  For sorting, I used
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary
    search algorithm</a> for finding the index of the value when
  inserting and checking containment. The binary search
  algorithm returns the index of the value:
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    def binary_search(self, value, l, start, end):
    middle = (start + end)/2
    # If this l is empty, 'start'
    # and 'end' will be the same.
    if end == start:
    return middle
    elif l[middle] == value:
    return middle

    # We don't need to consider middle anymore
    # because we ruled it out above.
    # So we recurse with middle +/- 1.
    # Here, we go with middle + 1.
    elif l[middle] < value:
                     return self.binary_search(value, l, middle + 1, end)
                     elif l[middle] > value:
      return self.binary_search(value, l, start, middle)
  </code>
</pre>
<p>
  <code>insert</code> inserts the value at the correct index that
  <code>binary_search</code> returned, with Python's built-in function,
  insert. <code>Contains</code> check returns True or False depending on
  whether the value at the index matches the queuried number:
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    def insert(self, value):
    index = self.binary_search(value, self.values, 0, len(self.values))
    # Index cannot be larger than the len(self.values)
    if index == len(self.values) or value != self.values[index]:
    # Use Python's built-in function, insert.
    self.values.insert(index, value)

    def contains(self, value):
    index = self.binary_search(value, self.values, 0, len(self.values))
    return index < len(self.values) and value == self.values[index]
   </code>
</pre>
<p>
  Insertion with sorted list algorithm has big-O of
  O(log<sub>2</sub>n)+O(n), which rounds to O(n). This would be when the
  inserting needs to occur at the first of the list, and all the
  items in the list are scooted to the right. The big-O of
  containment check is O(log<sub>2</sub>(n)).
</p>

<h3>Unsorted List Set</h3>
<p>
  The code for unsorted list is simple. When the <code>UnsortedListSet</code>
  is initialized, it creates an empty list:
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    class UnsortedListSet(object):
    def __init__(self):
    self.values = []
  </code>
</pre>
<p>
  For <code>insert</code> and <code>contains</code>, the algorithm checks one
  number at a time from index of zero to the end of the list:
</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    def insert(self, value):
    if not self.contains(value):
    self.values.append(value)

    def contains(self, value):
    for x in self.values:
    if x == value:
    return True
    return False
  </code>
</pre>
<p>
  The big-O of <code>insert</code> and <code>contains</code> for
  <code>UnsortedListSet</code> are both O(n).
</p>

<h2>Visualizing Performance</h2>
<p>
  I collected 100 data points of each set implementation. I used
  R and <a href="http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/">ggplot2</a>
  for visualizing the data. The plot of the data on a log<sub>2</sub>
  x-scale and y-scale looks like below:
</p>
<a href="/assets/2_all.png">
  <img src="/assets/2_all.png">
</a>
<p>
  While it appears that I collected each operation data at a
  different n-sizes, each group of four boxes actually belongs to
  one n-size. ggplot2 automatically spreads the box plots so that
  it's easier to see the individual boxes. I used box plot because
  it accentuates the subtle differences between operations with
  random and non-random ordered numbers, rather than overlapping
  them like a point plot would. Let's dive into the data a little
  more, and look at insertion and containment check separately.
</p>

<h3>Containment Check: non-random and random</h3>
<p>
  In the above plot in the <code>UnsortedListSet</code> plot, you can see
  that there are two extreme outliers that took about 2<sup>7</sup> times
  longer for completing the <code>contains</code> operation. It is
  odd that only two points are much slower than the other data
  points. I think it could have been either the order of the
  queries tested the worst case performance, or something
  interrupted the operations somehow. When sorted in decreasing
  order, you can see that these outliers are quite large
  compared to the third largest value.
</p>

<p>
  Either way, I decided to exclude the two outliers so that
  plots look cleaner. I wouldn't recommend completely excluding
  outliers usually, but in this case, there are only 2 points so
  I removed them from the data.
</p>
<a href="/assets/2_contains_wo_outliers.png">
  <img src="/assets/2_contains_wo_outliers.png">
</a>
<p>
  The big-O of containment-check would be O(log<sub>2</sub>(n))
  for <code>SortedListSet</code>, and O(n)
  for <code>UnsortedListSet</code>.
</p>
<p>
  It is clear that the time taken for <code>contains</code> in
  <code>SortedListSets</code> increases at a slower rate than in
  <code>UnsortedListSets</code>, as expected. It is interesting that the
  <code>SortedListSet</code> starts to significantly outperform
  <code>UnsortedListSet</code> at n > 2<sup>8</sup>. More
      interestingly, <code>SortedListSet</code> is in fact slower
      than <code>UnsortedListSet</code> when n-size is small. The
      overhead cost of sorting via binary search must be larger than
      the benefit of checking containment in a sorted list.
</p>
<p>
  The difference between checking containment of numbers in
  non-random and random orders into a <code>SortedListSet</code>
  almost does not exist. This is probably because every time a
  new number is added to the sorted list, the algorithm does
  binary search to find the correct index for the number. For
  a <code>SortedListSet</code>, whether the input numbers are in
  random or non-random order does not make a difference in the
  resulting list.
</p>
<p>
  This, however, is not true for a <code>UnsortedListSet</code>. If the input
  numbers are given in a random order, the resulting list will
  have numbers in a random order. <code>contains</code> in a
  randomly ordered list takes longer than in an ordered list, as
  you can see in the plot.
</p>
<h3>Insertion: non-random and random</h3>
<p>
  The big-O of insertion would be O(log<sub>2</sub>n + n), which
  rounds to O(n) for <code>SortedListSet</code>. This is the sum
  of bineary search
  and <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity">Python's
    built-in <code>insert</code>
    operation</a>. For <code>UnsortedListSet</code>, the big-O of
  insertion is O(n).
</p>
<a href=""./2_supp/2_insertion.png"">
  <img src="/assets/2_insertion.png">
</a>
<p>
  Like in <code>contains</code>, the time it takes to insert numbers
  increases at a slower rate in <code>SortedListSet</code>. Again,
  <code>SortedListSet</code> actually takes longer insertion time for n < 2<sup>8</sup>,
                                                                          and starts to outperform <code>UnsortedListSet</code> for n > 2<sup>8</sup>.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike <code>contains</code>, the difference between inserting
  numbers in random and non-random orders into
  a <code>SortedListSet</code> exists. This is because when
  inserting numbers in order, insertion is more like
  Python's <code>append</code>, because the new number is always
  added to the last of the list. In other words, none of the
  items in the list is moved, and its big-O is O(1). This is
  much smaller than when the inserting numbers in random order,
  which will have big-O of O(n). Meanwhile, insertion
  in <code>UnsortedListSet</code> follows a similar trend as
  its <code>contains</code>.
</p>
<p>
  One thing I cannot explain about insertion is how inserting randomly
  ordered numbers take shorter time than ordered numbers at n = 2<sup>4</sup>. It
  very well could be noise in data, or an interesting trend.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion and Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>
  I wanted to compare the real world performace to theoretical big-O
  in the plots, but I had difficult time representing the big-O. For
  example, I understand that insertion for <code>UnsortedListSet</code> is O(n) but
  that doesn't mean it should be plotted as y = x. What would be the
  coefficient? What about the intercept?
</p>
<p>
  I'm also looking forward to implementing and visualizing
  TreeSets. I wrote a script for
  a <code>UnbalancedTreeSet</code>, but for n > 2<sup>8</sup>,
  it would reach the recursion limit and crash. Currently, the
  algorithm is implemented recursively, and I'm thinking about
  how to do it iteratively.
