    </section>

    <section class="blog_content">
      <p>
        Lately, I have been working
        on <a href="https://github.com/jeenalee/sklearn_pmml">a Python
        library</a> for converting PMML represented machine learning
        models into Python scikit-learn classifiers that can be
        readily used for predictions. When setting up Travis-CI for
        automated code testing, I learned a few tricks and tips that are
        specific to scientific Python packages, such
        as <code>numpy</code> and <code>scipy</code>. If you are
        setting up Travis-CI for tests that are dependent on these
        Python packages and having build errors, hopefully this
        post will give you some ideas that you can test out.
      </p>

      <h2><code>pip</code> or <code>conda</code></h2>
      <p>
        I will write about installing Python packages in Travis-CI
        environment with
        <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip"><code>pip</code></a>
        and <a href="http://conda.pydata.org/docs/"><code>conda</code></a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Package Dependencies</h3>
      <p>
        My unittest code requires Python's machine learning library,
        scikit-learn. Scikit-learn package depends
        on <code>scipy</code>. <code>Scipy</code> depends
        on <code>numpy</code>, which requires Fortran packages <code>LAPACK</code>
        and <code>BLAS</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I've been happy with using <code>pip</code> for
        installing Python packages, I realized that it isn't efficient
        in installing bulk packages with complicated
        dependency relationship. <code>Pip</code> would attempt to install the
        last package on the dependency chain, and abort the build:

      <p>
        When I specified the order of packages to install by writing
        it an individual command line for each one of them, I ran into
        another issue, which is related to non-Python packages.
      </p>
      <h3>non-Python Packages</h3>
      <p>
        <code>Scipy</code> and <code>numpy</code> are written heavily
        in <code>C</code> to speed up the mathematical
        computations. <code>Numpy's</code> required packages include
        Fortran packages <code>LAPACK</code> and <code>BLAS</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>Pip</code> is a Python package installer, and it isn't
        great at installing non-Python packages. I
        noticed <code>numpy</code> and <code>scipy</code> will fail to
        install correctly because Travis could not
        find <code>LAPACK</code> and <code>BLAS</code>. Even after I
        tried installing them manually, the error would persist.
      </p>

      <h3><code>conda</code> to the Rescue</h3>
      <p>
        <code>Conda</code> is great for installing scientific
        packages. After reading many entries on Stack Overflow, I
        decided to try installing packages with Conda, and the
        environment was able to install the packages correctly! However, I ran into <code>ImportError</code>.
      </p>
      <img class="blog_content_image_larger" src="./3_supp/3_no_nose.png">
      <h2>Python Unittest Packages</h2>
      <p>
        Conda ignores any packages installed in the virtual
        environment, and therefore <code>nose</code> that was
        pre-installed in Travis had to be installed again. In fact, in
        virtual environments, ignoring pre-installed packages is an
        advantage, because it allows the user to paint on a completely
        blank canvas, rather than a canvas with some streaks drawn
        on. So I added <code>nose</code> to the packages to install,
        and voila, my build was successful, and so were my tests!

        Hope this post was helpful for you if you are about to build a
        scientific project on Travis. Thanks for reading!
